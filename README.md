<h2>Acknowledgement</h2>

Special thanks to JS Mastery on YouTube for coming up with this project. Through this project I learnt a lot of React and Tailwind Concepts like creating Reusable Components Routing Tailwind Best Practices and responsive design. It also cleared my confusions that I had with absolute and relative positioning in CSS.
